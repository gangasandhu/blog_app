# blog_app
A blog app created using Django
The app includes several features such as user authentication, profile creation, blog post creation, updating and deleting, commenting, and pages for blog posts.

Building this app required a solid understanding of web development, database design, and backend programming. I faced several challenges during the development process, such as implementing user authentication and authorization, handling blog post creation and updating, and designing an intuitive user interface.

To overcome these challenges, I utilized various tools and frameworks such as Django's built-in authentication system, Django templates for rendering HTML pages, and Tailwind CSS for styling. These tools allowed me to build a robust and user-friendly blog app that I am proud of.
